Nobody has yet been able to determine conclusively whether NP-complete problems are in fact solvable in polynomial time,
making this one of the great unsolved problems of mathematics. The Clay Mathematics Institute is offering a US $1
million reward to anyone who has a formal proof that P=NP or that Pâ‰ NP.
